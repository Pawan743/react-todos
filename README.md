# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
To run this app, first download "react-todos" as folder.
Then using "cd" command in command prompt, navigate to "react-todos" folder
Now enter  "npm run dev" command
Then local-host website will get printed, copy it and paste it in your browser to run.
Thank you
